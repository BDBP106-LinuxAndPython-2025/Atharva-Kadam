"""(3) How are packages different from modules? How are modules different from functions?
And how are methods different from functions?"""

"""
-Packages are directories while modules are the files in packages.
-Functions are pieces of codes present in the modules.
-Method requires an object while function just require arguments
eg. 
Method: list.append(i) in here list is the object while append is method
Function: add(9,1) in here add is the function and 9,1 are the arguments passed to it
