#(1) What does the command set ("letters") do? Explain
print(set("letters"))
#it creates a set of the string letters where in the elements are the individual letters of the string "letters"
#and since it is a set it removes the duplicate elements and only consists of unique elements
#that,s why in the output "e" is only printed once and "t" is also only printed once though both of these letters have occurred more than once
