""""(2) One can create a set from several different objects â€“ lists, tuples and dictionaries. Come
up with an example for each object type, and create a set out of that object using the
set() function. In the case of a dictionary, what does the set contain?."""

#in the case of dictionary, the set only contains the keys of the dictionary and when we print the dictionary, there itself it doesn't give the repeating duplicate keys.
#and so in the set as well the keys are only shown without any duplicates
